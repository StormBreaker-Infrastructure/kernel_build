Kernel build system usage:

Ways to specify what to build:
    # Set up the shell environment.
    source build/envsetup.sh

    # Select the device to target. In the case of no argument,
    # the script will fail.
    setupDevice [<target>] # Selects the device to target

    # Build the kernel defconfig.
    buildDefconfig

    # Build the kernel image.
    buildKernelImage

    # Build both defconfig and kernel image.
    # This will select both the defconfig and the kernel image target.
    buildKernel
