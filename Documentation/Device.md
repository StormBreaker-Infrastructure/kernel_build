## Ways to generate the device-specific tree structure

### The tree is generated to define device specific flags.
### The generated device tree is required to be stored at
    device/${OEM_NAME}/${TARGET_DEVICE_CODENAME}

#### The `OEM_NAME` is the manufacturer of the target device.
#### The `TARGET_DEVICE_CODENAME` is the codename of the target device.
